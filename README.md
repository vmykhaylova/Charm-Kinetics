# Charm-Kinetics

A set of figures enabling the analysis of the time evolution of the charm quark yield in the quark–gluon plasma (QGP). The charm quark production rate, and consequently the total number of charm--anticharm pairs, were investigated for two scenarios: one-dimensional propagation of the QGP treated as an ideal fluid (the so-called Bjorken flow), and a more realistic (2+1)-dimensional expansion of the plasma, accounting for its temperature-dependent specific shear viscosity.

All figure descriptions and the detailed analysis can be found in: http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23825.
